# What is PySWASH

PySWASH is a python based package for visualizing and processing model-generated simulation results obtained with SWASH: an open source wave-flow numerical model. You can contact me at: m.miani[at]cyi.ac.cy, and put [PySWASH] in the mail subject. It might take a while to respond...
I am happy for any feedback, (constructive) criticism, or proposal to expand/improve the tool as it still is perfectible.

# About the tool

The package is under developement, and there still is a ample room for improvement. Please report bugs or problems. There is a brief user manual available, explaining the logics of the coding and processing. 

## Manual

Before start using the tool, I suggest to read the manual especially part "3.5 Dictionary". The manual contains anexes. 

# Misc.
Both code and manual where produced in late 2020, while listening at https://youtu.be/9Ri7TcukAJ8, https://youtu.be/_qdFXMBt73w, https://youtu.be/VqabEZ2uhLE,
